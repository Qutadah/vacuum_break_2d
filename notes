NEW CHECKS:

** REMOVE DISCONTINUITIES
** REMOVE MASS DEPOSITION

- check values, divergence.
- do we need axial velocity and frost layer and convection?
- check functions correctness.
- remove averaging of density...
- increase pipe length/ add steel pipe to enable flow directioning........
- should i start simulation from the boundaries or inside.. m=0 or 1. This doesnt matter with smoothing....

done:

- saturated pressure values are similar to 1d: saturation pressure, mdot calc 1.7822794978752264e-29
- viscosity has been checked and giving similar results to 1d, 2.3238190624267303e-07, however there is no viscous term in the 1d.

TODO:

-saturation pressure is high starting in 1d bao ~ 78010291.13788661, later it becomes order e-29 if there is m_out..

- dr squared term, density is very low which overestimates the viscous term in the velocity equation... and causes velocity to increase dramatically.. How to solve it?
- check the viscous term ... how to control it... reduced time stepping so that the dt term is not very small..
- saturated temp for mdot calculation:~ 50, in 1d it was ~ 20.
- check q_h function... its a fitting.
  check dt2nd derivative, its causing problems.

- DENSITY IS THE SOURCE OF ALL MY PROBLEMS..... I SHOULD AVERAGE IT SOMEHOW....

- TODO: CHECK

- check mass deposition for best dt, dr, dx. NOT GETTING ANY CORRECT VALUES. used x equation.

- TODO:
- check dt2nd differencing, inlet cancel...

NEXT:

- perform linear stability analysis
- write down all parameters between 1d and 2d code for mass deposition.
- RK4 time integration.
- WENO or Lax for dt2nd_axial_ux.
- TVD limiter for first gradients.
- fix the pressure term. - Use WENO reconstruction.

- plot pressure, temperature ad

- DONE THIS WEEK 12.06:
- add numpy.delete(arr, obj, axis=None) for the first column in the 2d arrays.. r=0 not calculated.
- make sure r=0 is not accessed, all values are hardcoded.
- fix differencing method at n==1
- fixed energy equation.
- recalculated pressure for the next iteration, wasnt updating the pressure before.
- modularized code for understandability.
- Checked values from functions and made sure they give correct results.
- deriving m_sound equation... It is not giving correct values.

- WEEK 18.06:

- IS de2 needed ?? there is de1 input to m_de function.
- can q1 be negative? Is Ts always higher than Tw? Am i considering this in the equations?
- parabolic velocity profile at inlet, and calculating all corresponding properties.
- checked all q*h, delta*, q1 functions for Ts, tw.
- radial velocity relation with mass deposition is a mistake... I think we need momentum R equation. The rate of change of thickness in SN2 layer is controlled by mass deposition.
- do we use de1 or de2 for calculating ur2 ?
- subplots of all properties inlet conditions and calculated properties at each timestep.
- You reached bulk ur2 calculation, continue
