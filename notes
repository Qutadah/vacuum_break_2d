TODO:

-saturation pressure is high starting in 1d bao ~ 78010291.13788661, later it becomes order e-29 if there is m_out..

- dr squared term, density is very low which overestimates the viscous term in the velocity equation... and causes velocity to increase dramatically.. How to solve it?
- check the viscous term ... how to control it... reduced time stepping so that the dt term is not very small..
- saturated temp for mdot calculation:~ 50, in 1d it was ~ 20.
- check q_h function... its a fitting.
  check dt2nd derivative, its causing problems.

- DENSITY IS THE SOURCE OF ALL MY PROBLEMS..... I SHOULD AVERAGE IT SOMEHOW....

- TODO: CHECK

- check mass deposition for best dt, dr, dx. NOT GETTING ANY CORRECT VALUES. used x equation.

- WEEK 18.06:

- can q1 be negative? Is Ts always higher than Tw? Am i considering this in the equations?
- parabolic velocity profile at inlet, and calculating all corresponding properties.
- checked all q*h, delta*, q1 functions for Ts, tw.
- radial velocity relation with mass deposition is a mistake... I think we need momentum R equation. The rate of change of thickness in SN2 layer is controlled by mass deposition.
- do we use de1 or de2 for calculating ur2 ?
- subplots of all properties inlet conditions and calculated properties at each timestep.

- NOTE: Calculate the gas temperature and ensure it's higher than the SN2 surface temperature .... VERY IMPORTANT
- NOTE: check false tg = ts important
  NOTE Check Ts = Tg BC in surface loop.
  pressure is higher on surface because energy flux in the radial direction towards the wall. therefore all energy gets converted to

TODO NEW WEEK:

- fix symmetry condition at u=1
- make 2d contour plot of derivatives.
- inviscid flow simulation.
- calculate Peclet number.
- Central difference scheme fails to converge for Peclet number greater than 2.
- Upwind differencing scheme is applicable for Pe > 2 for positive flow .
- check characteristic length used grid size or Hydraulic diameter to evaluate peclet number.
- peclet numer is ~ 1000 for my actual viscous case with ux = 1 meter.
- employ flux vector splitting.
-
- deriving m_sound equation... It is not giving correct values.

- TODO:
- check dt2nd differencing, inlet cancel...

TODO: VISCOUS FLOW - laminar
NEXT:

- perform linear stability analysis
- RK4 time integration.
- WENO or Lax for dt2nd_axial_ux.
- TVD limiter for first gradients.

- plot pressure, temperature ad

TODO: VISCOUS FLOW - high speed, use flux splitting scheme

- Solve Riemann problem: apply Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions, which describe the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy across the discontinuity. These conditions relate the properties of the flow on both sides of the discontinuity, allowing for the determination of the wave speeds and the distribution of the flow variables.

NOTE:
CONCLUSIONS.

- pressure energy and pressure rises, which creates a pressure gradient in the radial ddirection inwards towards the center of the duct and therefore a negative radial velocity. read Dean flow
- to make energy consistent, make all differencing schemes consistent in al equations including navier stokes.
- upwind differencing in my case since its a one directional flow. 1st order implemented.
- energy equation inconsistent. Fix.

EXTRA

- should i include convective term, and last n away from wall? This will need mesh refinement, as m_de is very small and to give us correct ur values, it needs to be in the control volume, and if its away from the grid point, the values are not necessarily correct.
